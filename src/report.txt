Introduction
Super-resolution microscopy has become, with recent developments, a fundamental source of data in the field of biology. On top of this, imaging techniques like PALM have been combined with single-particle tracking [8], allowing to reconstruct thousands of simultaneous particle trajectories at increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution. With the availability of this large
quantity of information, new data analysis techniques are needed to extract
relevant biophysical features that can give new insights on the biological processes. Existing knowledge from physics and mathematics can provide a
solid base to build a toolset of statistical and analytical methods to accomplish
this goal. Langevin’s equation and stochastic processes have been extensively—
and successfully—used to model the dynamics of biological systems [12]. Likewise, regression and unsupervised learning algorithms represent a powerful tool to classify and analyze the large amount of data produced by singleparticle tracking. Valuable insights can be obtained by carefully joining data
driven methods and theoretical modelling. Either approaches are valid but
may not be sufficient, per se, to reveal the inner significance of certain processes; their combination can instead provide hints about the deeper mechanisms of life. Redundancy, for example, seems to be a fundamental principle in many biological processes, as the joint application of narrow escape
model and numerical simulations has suggested [11, 13, 1]. Yet to be understood problems in biology can benefit hugely from this twofold approach.
Gathering of high resolution datasets paves the way to new and promising
discoveries. On the other hand, data is useless without a solid framework to
analyse and explain it. Overwhelming availability of data can even be counterproductive, as it makes the extraction of meaningful patterns more complicated. Dealing with this challenges is going to be, in the very near future,
one of the major efforts in all fields of scientific research.
Here I will present some results regarding data analysis, modelling and
numerical simulations. The fil rouge connecting the whole work is the search
for explanation of the dynamics of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates in neurons,
which are known to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease [2].
This report is organized in two parts. Section 1 is about analysis of SPT
data. While the dataset used here specifically concerns Aβ aggregates, the
final aim is to build a general methodological framework to allow the extraction of biophysical features from SPT recordings. Based on the analysis of the
amyloid beta data, a preliminary model of motion involving the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) has been developed by Holcman’s team [4]. Following these
results, section 2 regards numerical simulations that I developed to better
understand the biological implications of the model.

1 Extraction of biophysical features from SPT data
Modern imaging methods such as PALM or STORM have made possible to
track simultaneously multiple particles at high spatiotemporal resolution.
Single-particle tracking (SPT) techniques can then be used to reconstruct thousands of particle trajectories. To extract meaningful insights from this huge
amount of data, we need a modelling and statistical framework.
The data presented here was provided by the Molecular Neuroscience
Group at the University of Cambridge, UK. It consists into trajectory fragments of amyloid beta aggregates observed in HEK 293T cells. Nevertheless,
the statistical methods described in the following provide a general framework to extract dynamical parameters of particles at cell scale. The SPT trajectories were in most cases provided by the Molecular Neuroscience Group
and sometimes obtained from imaging data using the TrackMate software
[15]. The tools developed to extract biophysical features were implemented
into a Python package @todo:cite, which allows to flexibly analyse new datasets.

1.1 Effective dynamical model
At the microscopic level, the motion of the molecules can be described by
Langevin’s equation. In the case of biological processes we are interested in,
the Langevin dynamics can be considered in its large friction limit (Smoluchowski’s equation) [7, 5]
F (x) √
ẋ =
+ 2Dẇ
(1)
γ
where F (x) is the drift force exerted on the particle at position x, γ is the friction coefficient, D is the diffusion coefficient and w(t) is a two-dimensional
Wiener process. At this scale, it makes sense to consider the diffusion to be
mainly due to thermal agitation so that it can be considered isotropic.
However, it is not possible to directly recover the microscopic model from
the SPT data, since we miss information about the local behaviour both in
space (such as the presence of microscopic obstacles undetected by the imaging device) and time (such as thermal fluctuations much faster than the acquisition timescale). We can still build a coarse-grained model [7, 5], transforming eq. 1 into the effective stochastic equation
√
ẋ = a(x) + 2B ẇ
(2)
where a(x) is the effective velocity field and D ≡ B T B is the effective diffusion tensor. It must be noted that, in principle, the effective diffusion coefficient may not be isotropic since it takes into account the local microscopic
features (e.g. obstacles). On the other hand, actual analysis of the data show
that anisotropic components are negligible: in the following, the diffusion

tensor is reduced for simplicity to a scalar coefficient by averaging on the diagonal entries. Moreover, the velocity field is assumed time invariant in the
relatively short time window spanned by the SPT data (30–60 s).

1.2 Diffusion and velocity field estimation
To estimate the dynamical parameters of eq. 2 a statistical analysis is needed.
We follow the approach demontrated in [7, 5, 6, 3] by partitioning the data in
a square grid with fixed bin size (@todo: figure). The velocity field and diffusion coefficients are considered constant in each bin. However, we take
a different approach concerning the statistical estimators. Instead of stopping at the first order in the acquisition time interval ∆t, we consider the full
statistical distribution of the parameters.
If the acquisition time interval is sufficiently small, the process described
by eq. 2 can be discretized following a forward Euler scheme:
√
xt+1 − xt = a(xt )∆t + 2∆tD(xt )ηt
(3)
where ∆t is the acquisition time interval.
Then, the trajectory step ∆xt ≡ xt+1 − xt starting in bin B is a normally
distributed random variable with mean a(xB ) and variance 2D(xB )∆t where
xB is the center of the bin. The velocity field and diffusion tensor can thus
be recovered by computing the empirical estimate of the moments:

D(xB ) =
2∆t
a(xB ) =

(5)

where the expected value is taken on the bin.

1.3 Field smoothening
To perform analysis and simulations we often need a smooth representation
of the velocity or diffusion field, provinding also estimations for bins with few
or missing data. To solve this problem, a convolution with variable kernel is
applied on the field. Denoting by nB the number of datapoints inside bin B,
the smoothened field ã is obtained as
∑
nS a(xS )
ã(xB ) = (k ∗ a)(xB ) ≡

S∈Γ(B)

∑

nS ′

(6)

S ′ ∈Γ(B)

where Γ(B) is the Moore neighbourhood of B.
Explicitly, representing bins with their grid site indices, the kernel matrix
K(i, j) centered in the bin i, j is:


ni−1,j−1 ni−1,j ni−1,j+1

K(i, j) =
j+1
i+1 ∑
∑
ni+1,j−1 ni+1,j ni+1,j+1
nk,l
k=i−1 l=j−1

Finally, bins such that the total number of samples in their Moore neighbourhood is lower than a threshold are excluded from the analysis.
This approach can be interpreted in terms of Bayesian inference, where
the prior (Gaussian) distribution of the parameter of interest is based on the
distributions in the neighbouring bins. The mean estimator on the posterior
is then obtained by averaging the means of the neighbours with a weight proportional to the number of samples.

1.4 Regions of coherent motion
Regions of coherent motion are identified by clustering adjacent bins based
on the angular distance of the velocity vectors. The angular distance between
two vectors u and v is defined as:
(
)
1
u·v
distance(u, v) ≡ arccos
(8)
π
∥u∥∥v∥
A very simple algorithm works as follows:
1. Create an empty cluster (i.e. a set of adjacent bins) for each bin in the
grid and assign the bin to it.
5

2. For every bin B, consider each neighbouring bin S ∈ Γ(B). If the angular distance between ã(xB ) and ã(xS ) is lower than a given threshold,
merge the clusters of B and S.
This extremely simple clustering method is quite effective in localising correlated motion and can be easily extended to also consider time evolution.
The identification of regions of coherent motion can have relevant application in many biological contexts. As an example, coherent motion regions
have been observed in interphase chromatin [16], @todo new hypothesis about
its biological functions.

1.5 Potential wells
To identify local attractors we use the methodology and formalism developed
in [7, 10]. Considering the velocity field to be locally conservative, it can be
described by the gradient of a scalar potential:
a(x) = −∇U (x)

(9)

Local attractors can then be seen as wells in the potential. At first non-zero
order around a local minumum x0 the potential is a paraboloid:
[
]
(x − x0 )2 (y − y0 )2
U (x, y) = U0 + A
+
+ O(x, y)2
(10)
rx2
ry2
in a coordinate system (x, y) where the axes are rotated by an angle φ to match
those of the paraboloid. A potential well is thus by the set of parameters A
(well depth), x0 (centre), r1 , r2 (axes of the ellipse obtained by cutting the
potential well at height A), and φ (the angle of the ellipse major axis).
If the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be locally constant, the particle
density is described by the Boltzmann distribution
(
)
U (x, y)
ρ(x, y) ∝ exp −
(11)
D
Substituting eq. 10, the density around a local minimum is approximately
Gaussian. Thus, after selecting a small high density region, principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to approximate the location of the attractor
(x0 ) and the ellipse parameters (φ, r1 , r2 ) corresponding to the 95% confidence ellipse.
To find the remaining parameter A an iterative procedure is used. A grid
centered in x0 is built, and for each iteration k an ellipse Ek with increasingly
longer axis is obtained by rescaling the original confidence ellipse. At each
iteration, we calculate the Ak that minimize the mean squared error (MSE)
with respect to the velocity field of all the bins inside E:
∑
MSEk =
∥ − ∇U (xi ) − a(xi )∥2
(12)
xi ∈Ek

The best fit for A is then the Ak corresponding to the iteration with minimal
MSE.
A parabolic error score S indicating how much the potential well resembles
a paraboloid is defined as
S≡∑

(13)

where S ∈ [0, 1] and S = 0 indicates a perfect fit.
The initial high density regions are localized by using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

1.6 Linking coherent motion regions to potential wells
It is possible to obtain a rough dynamical map of the cell by connecting the
regions of coherent motion and the potential wells to form a directed graph.
First, the axis corresponding to the average direction of each region is computed; then the endpoints of the regions are connected to other endpoints or
potential wells that are found in a small neighbourhood. The result is visible
in figure 2.
This can provide a new way to understand the macroscopic dynamical
structure of the cell, relative to the observed molecule.

1.7 Multiscale analysis
To investigate how the scale influences the detection of the features, the methods described in the previous sections were applied on different grid sizes.

7

Regions of coherent drift, given their non-locality, tends to persist across
different choices of the grid size. Also, as the grid size is increased, the clusters
expand.
The localization of potential wells is instead very sensible to the grid size.
This is expected and confirms their local nature. As the grid size is reduced,
more and more local minima of the potential are found. The average error
score of the wells is slightly decreasing as the grid size increases. This may be
due the higher noise present at small grid sizes, where number of datapoints
in each bin is smaller.

2 Modelling motion on the endoplasmic reticulum
Analysis of SPT data for amyloid beta aggregates in multiple cells types [4] has
revealed a 2-state like dynamics, where particles jump at high speed between
low velocity diffusive regions. Identifying the low speed regions as nodes
and the jumps as edges, it is possible to reconstruct a network structure. The
characteristics of this network seem compatible to those of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), suggesting that amyloid beta aggregates may move on it. The
ER is a wide network-like organelle that spans from the nuclear envelope to
the cell periphery. It has a fundamental role in protein maturation and trafficking, altough it takes a role in various other cellular processes [@todo: add
examples]. A recent study based on superresolution imaging [9] has revealed
in its entirety the ER network structure, made amost exclusively of tubules
at varying densities. However, the characteristics of molecule transport remain unclear. How are molecules redistributed in the ER? Which timescale
characterise this transport process? To answer these questions, we consider
two models that describe the motion on an ER-like graph.
Undirected model A toy model where particles move randomly from node
to node through undirected edges. Each particle waits an exponential time
in each node (timescale τnode ), and then randomly jumps to one of the three
neighbours. The exponential waiting represents the time required to escape
from a confined diffusive region (the node) through the small window that
connects it to the high drift tubule, as described by the narrow escape theory
[14].
Switching model A more elaborated model that takes into account the effect of tubule constrictions (observed in imaging data). The network graph is
directed but each edge inverts its direction at a Poissonian rate. This means
that the edge will keep a directionality for an exponential time (timescale
τswitch ), then reverse it, and so on and so forth. Particles travelling in the network wait an exponential time in each node (τnode ) and then jump randomly
through one of the available outward directed edges. If all the edges happen
to be directed inwards, the particle is trapped and has to wait another exponential time in the node.
Starting from these models, I developed numerical simulations to understand
the effect that model parameters have on the transport process. Two main
quantities have important biological implications: the mean first passage
time (MFPT) through a given node for a single particle; the average time required for the first particle among a group to reach a given node. This second
case models an activation process where many particles are released from a
source but one is sufficient to activate a receptor located in a far away node.

2.1 Network structures
Regions at the periphery of the ER are made by a network of tubules with
roughly three-way junctions. We can thus model the ER as graph where nodes
have average degree 3. While one can easily generate random graphs fullfilling this requirement by means of relatively easy algorithms, these structures usually lack a clear spatial structure, since each node may be connected
to any other node regardless of its position. To overcome the problems of the
random graphs and to simplify a possible analytical study of the system, we
limit our analysis to planar graphs. In the following, we will use an hexagonal
lattice (in both finite and periodic variations) to provide an abstract representation of the ER. Finally, we can reconstruct a planar graph from SPT data
as demonstrated in [parrutto_er] and compare its characteristics to those of
the abstract lattices. Examples of the three structures are shown in figs. 5a
to 5c; characteristics of the graphs are summarized in table 1.

11

2.2 Mean first passage time
Considering a particle moving on graph starting from node S, the first passage time (or hitting time) for node T is the time at which the particle first
hits the target T . Formally,
τS→T (X) = inf {t : X(t) = T | X(0) = S}

(14)

where X(t) denotes the location of the particle at time t. [@todo: fix definition] It follows that, if X(t) describes a stochastic motion, we can define the
mean first passage time τ̄ as
τ̄S→T = EX [τS→T (X) | X(0) = S]

(15)

where the expectation is taken over many realization of the process.

2.3 Extreme first passage time
We now consider a more general case, where N particles move simultaneously on the network, starting from the same source node S. In this case, we
may be interested in knowing the average time required for the first among
the N particles to hit the target T . This is a common situation in biological
systems, where a single particle—or just few of them—can activate a receptor.
We define this as the minimum hitting time among N processes:
ex
τS→T
(N ) = min {τS→T (X1 ), τS→T (X2 ), . . . , τS→T (XN )}

(16)

We can then take the average over many realizations of this multiple-particle
process to define
ex
ex
τ̄S→T
(N ) = E{X1 ,X2 ,...,XN } [τS→T
(N )]

(17)

We name this last quantity the extreme first passage time (EFPT).
@todo: - timescale much smaller - convergence towards optimal trajectory - 1/logN behaviour of tau ex as in continuous case (cite Kanishka)
- frequency of trapping not sufficient to justify timescale
